# AccessibleFlowChart
* House 1 utilizes Spatial Audio, House 2 does not.
* In order to interact with the houses, use the arrows to toggle between parents and children (up/down arrow) and across other items of the same level (right/left arrow).
* If you reach a "dead end", you will hear a thump indicating that there is nowhere left to traverse.
* Be sure to disable screenreaders before interacting with the demo (we have our own audio source that will be used for navigating the graph).
* In the spatial audio demo, pressing 'Enter' allows you to play the information of a current node. 
* In the spatial audio demo, pressing 'Shift' allows you to disable tone summaries played after the name of the element, and also to re-enable it.
